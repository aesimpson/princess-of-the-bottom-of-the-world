                             <b>Southern Ocean to Antarctica (2007) &mdash; </b>Northeast of the Antarctic Peninsula, straddling the boundary between the Scotia Sea and the Weddell Sea, the surface seems to be covered more by ice than open water. Thin sea ice grows from the salt water, but tabular icebergs that have broken off Antarctica can be more than a mile long and taller than ships, which doesn’t take into account that about 90% of their mass hides below the waterline. Uneven melting, fracturing apart, and tumbling over due to top-heaviness are actions that all help to dramatically shape icebergs. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

But on a small ice floe, north of the Antarctic Peninsula, it has found a friendly pair of chinstrap penguins. Not long after the ship encountered them, all three penguins dropped to their bellies, slid into the water, and swam off together. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

                           <b>Gerlache Strait to Cuverville Island, Antarctica (2007) &mdash; </b>Rampant whaling decimated the waters of Antarctica and the surrounding regions. Whales, like this humpback, still have not recovered. Some countries, with dubious rationales, continue to hunt whales in Antarctica. I’ve seen many more whales on single whale watching trips, lasting only a few hours, off the coast of Monterey, California, than compared to my combined time of nearly a month at sea in these pillaged waters.
