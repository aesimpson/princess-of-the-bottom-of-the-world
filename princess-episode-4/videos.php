							Cuverville Island, Antarctica (2007) — A gentoo penguin collects rocks to strengthen a nest with its mate and two chicks inside. This heartwarming act of parental support comes with some rather suspicious behavior.

							<b>Paulet Island, Antarctica (2007) — </b>An iceberg washed ashore turns into a snow cone for a Adélie penguin. Penguins have a special gland called a supraorbital that filters out salt from their blood. The excess salt is then secreted out of the nasal passage. However, penguins do also depend on freshwater for hydration. Streams and pools are naturally sources, but penguins also eat ice.

							<b>Deception Island, Antarctica (2007) — </b>Traveling on a penguin highway at Baily Head on the outer rim of the volcanic caldera that forms the island, chinstrap penguins march to and from their giant nesting colony on along a meltwater stream. A pass cut through mountainous rocks give them access to the ocean. They do a decidedly good job at staying in their lanes.

							<b>Deception Island, Antarctica (2007) — </b>Continuing to use the inside of an active volcano for bases and harbors after it has repeatedly erupted, destroying some of the bases, illustrates how challenging it is to find safe haven from Antarctica’s severe conditions.

							<b>Drake Passage to Ushuaia, Argentina (2007) — </b>The world’s roughest seas are found in the Drake Passage. Reports of waves big enough to cause major damage to passenger ships making the run between Antarctica and the tip of South America are not uncommon. These three views show the view out my cabin’s porthole, the bow of the ship, and the clinometer, which measures the amount of side-to-side roll of the ship (over 57° and the ship doesn’t roll back). The seas here weren’t too bad. However, a wave 65 feet tall was reported days after this crossing.
