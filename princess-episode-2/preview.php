                            The waters surrounding Antarctica are the coldest, roughest, and most isolated on the planet. If the passengers had to abandon the ship, then one of two fully enclosed lifeboats aboard would be the only chance of survival. Its vivid, reddish orange color is a safety requirement, allowing it to be spotted from great distances, including by satellites. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

                            Rockhopper penguins return to New Island with their bellies full after foraging at sea for krill, squid, and fish. Heavy surf is hardly an obstacle for them compared to the South American sea lions patrolling the waters just offshore. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

                            Though the smallest penguin species in the region, the rockhopper penguin more than makes up for it by also being one of the feistiest inhabitants of the Falkland Islands. This rockhopper was caught in midair during a rock hop. (Photo by Dan Linehan)
