<b>Beagle Channel to Ushuaia, Argentina (2007) &mdash; </b>The waters surrounding Antarctica are the coldest, roughest, and most isolated on the planet. If the passengers had to abandon the ship, then one of two fully enclosed lifeboats aboard would be the only chance of survival. Its vivid, reddish orange color is a safety requirement, allowing it to be spotted from great distances, including by satellites. (Photo by Dan Linehan)</p>

<b>Ushuaia, Argentina (2006) &mdash; </b>Looking more like a mini submarine, the motorized lifeboat had a capacity for 43 people, and, except for the pilot’s, all seats faced inward and had heavy straps to hold people securely against the hull. On an elevated seat, the pilot could navigate by looking out the small windows on top. The lifeboat was self-righting in case large waves rolled it over. (Photo by Dan Linehan)</p>

<b>Steeple Jason, Falklands (2007) &mdash; </b>With a maximum wingspan that reaches nearly 8 feet, the black-browed albatross is an amazingly efficient flyer. It spends most of its life at sea, can soar hundreds of miles a day in search of food, and is a frequent passerby of ships in the open ocean. (Photo by Dan Linehan)</p>

<b>New Island, Falklands (2006) &mdash; </b>With hungry chicks anxiously waiting back at their nests, rockhoppers returning from the ocean after feeding must climb over giant strands of Durvillaea kelp exposed by the low tide. “Seaweed” and “algae” are names that just don’t do it justice. Kelps are the bushes and tall trees of the ocean. In large numbers, they are rain forests of biodiversity and breeding grounds for countless species of sea life that humans depend upon.

<b>New Island, Falklands (2006) &mdash; </b>To survive in the harsh conditions of these remote islands, animals must be opportunistic feeders.
