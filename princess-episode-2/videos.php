                            <b>Steeple Jason, Falklands (2007) &mdash; </b>Hundreds of thousands of dazzling black-browed albatrosses nest at this island in a colony that stretches up and down the coast. Out of colonies for all albatross species, it is the second largest in the world. Though these numbers seem vast, black-browed albatrosses were considered endangered during the years surrounding the time this video was taken. So many of them were here.
