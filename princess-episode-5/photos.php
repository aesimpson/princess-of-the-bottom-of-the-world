                            <b>Tierra del Fuego, Argentina (2007) &mdash; </b>Distant relatives of camels, guanacos are one of four similar-looking species that include llamas, alpacas, and vicuñas. Grazers traveling in small herds, guanacos roam throughout Patagonia. Though one of the largest terrestrial mammals in South America, they still fall prey to natural predators, such as foxes and pumas. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

As I photographed the caiman in the still water above Iguazú Falls, a bunch of knuckleheads started throwing pesos. I couldn’t believe it. I was outraged. I wanted to throw them in. But the caiman was too small to eat them and probably would have been scared off. That wouldn’t have done any good. So, I just yelled at them until they stopped and left. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

In the subtropical jungle surrounding Iguazú Falls, traveling tree to tree by vine was much harder than it looks. But, I will add this: after falling on my ass, I learned that it was easier to swing from the thinner vine. (Photo courtesy of Dan Linehan)
