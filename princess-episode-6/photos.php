Most made it to Paulet Island. But those shown in this exhibit at Ushuaiaâ€™s Maritime Museum overwintered at Esperanza Bay on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. All the explorers were eventually rescued by the <i>Uruguay</i>, a sailing ship from Argentina. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

                            <b>Ushuaia, Argentina (2007) &mdash; </b>Flying in a four-seat airplane with Aeroclub Ushuaia gives specular views of seaport, the surrounding mountains, and the Beagle Channel. However, Ushuaia is well-known as one of the hardest places to fly around because of how quickly and drastically the weather conditions change. Heading west over the Beagle Channel, the airplane must take a steep turn away from the oncoming storm funneling down the channel. Ahead of the distant rain, the whipped-up water indicates that high winds are fast approaching. (Photo by Dan Linehan)
