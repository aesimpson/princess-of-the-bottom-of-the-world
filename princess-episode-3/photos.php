As the ship tips one way or the other, the bubbles remain at the highest points, so the amount of roll can be read from the scales. This clinometer shows a roll to the right of between 1&deg; and 2&deg; while en route. In rough seas it was not uncommon for the top tube to be maxed out. However, if a roll to the left or right maxed out the bottom tube, the ship would not roll back. It would sink. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

                            <b>Prion Island, South Georgia (2007) &mdash; </b>Antarctic fur seals are very territorial and aggressive. They bark loudly and even charge. I got charged at a bunch of times. I didn’t carry a walking stick or anything like that. If a fur seal did make a run at me, I’d have to lift my leg up so that its snout would hit the sole of my boot. That was enough to stop it and have it back away. I learned this trick from one of the guides—and I’m still walking around with both feet. However, these pups were just two big puffs of fur. They tried so hard to be fierce, tiny growling and all. It was completely endearing. I found myself saying to them, “Yes, I’m terrified. You’re doing such a fine job.” (Photo by Dan Linehan)

Wandering albatrosses can easily fly hundreds of miles a day on feeding runs that extend for thousands of miles. They cover these enormous distances by specialized soaring that allows them to ride the winds and hardly flap their wings. In fact, they use less energy flying than they do sitting on the water.

Considering the speed at which they all waddle, this would be a very long chase. But actually, there was one chinstrap penguin—just one—at almost every single one of our landing sites. I’m far from an animal behaviorist, but I do have a wild theory about why one and only one chinstrap was at each of these landing sites. The chinstraps are possibly trying to convert the other penguins to their version of penguinism. Chinstraps send out these emissaries, or missionaries, if you like. Looking closely at the chinstrap’s namesake, doesn’t it look like a Jesuit beard? (Photo by Dan Linehan)

Nor will it degrade over the course of the lifetimes of many other creatures. When large nets are lost from boats or discarded on purpose into the sea, they float around until they are so full of dead animals that they sink to the bottom. After enough of the dead animals are removed from the nets by decomposition or by bottom-feeders, the nets float back up and start the deadly cycle all over again. These are called ghost nets. During a light snow, this juvenile fur seal tries to pull at the nylon netting that is choking it to death as it grows. It doesn’t have much time left to live. Every time the seal feeds, it is slowly killing itself. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

                            <b>Cumberland Bay to Grytviken, South Georgia (2007) &mdash; </b>The Southern Ocean is full of enormous factory fishing ships. At times it seems there are more of them visible than whales. I wish I was only being poetic here. Hundreds of feet long, they practice three main types of fishing: netting, long-lining, and bottom-dragging. Krill is the lifeblood of the Southern Ocean. These inch-long, shrimplike animals feed the fish, the penguins, the other birds, the seals, and the whales. They are a keystone species. In other words, without krill, the waters and the land of Antarctica and its surroundings would essentially be barren of life as we now recognize it. Monterey learned the hard way when fisheries collapsed after sardines were overfished and the sea otter, another keystone species, was about 50 animals away from extinction. Ships similar to this one use gigantic nets to scoop up the krill by the ton. For bottom-fishing, nets are also used. But the nets are dragged along the seafloor. The seafloor is stripped clean, and the ecosystem is left in ruins. Not everything caught in the nets is being targeted. This bycatch of dead and dying animals is then tossed overboard. The last main technique is long-line fishing. Here a ship trails lines that are up to 50 miles long. As the long lines are set with hooks and bait, seabirds, especially albatrosses, try to get the bait before it sinks. They get hooked and drown. Worldwide, more than 100,000 albatrosses a year get killed by fishing vessels. Since there is little regulation and enforcement, even the simplest fixes, which could save countless animals from becoming collateral damage, are not employed. Out of sight, out of mind. This is the kind of stuff that doesn’t make it onto the television shows. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

                            <b>Gold Harbour, South Georgia (2007) &mdash; </b>By far the largest of all seals, male southern elephant seals can reach about 8,800 pounds. The species exhibits extreme sexual dimorphism, with females only weighing up to 2,000 pounds. The subadult elephant seals gathered here are already about as long as the Zodiacs.

                            <b>Gold Harbour, South Georgia (2007) &mdash; </b>The light-mantled sooty albatross is another rare albatross nesting on South Georgia. This small albatross prefers more solitary, hillside nests tucked away in the high tussac grass. Like wanderers, they have a two-year breeding cycle. Research indicates that their populations, just like the wanderers’, are significantly declining due to being hooked and drowned by long-line fishing. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

                            <b>Shingle Cove, South Orkneys (2007) &mdash; </b>The vibrant colors of this Adélie penguin colony have very surprising demarcations. The grey, rocky surface with a patch of snow in the background has few penguins. In the middle ground, yellowish-orange lichen coats rock sticking up from a green carpet of moss. A few penguins can be seen here, too. The largest congregation of penguins, mostly chicks, collects in the foreground. Here, their excrement, produced after healthily dining on iodine-containing krill, infuses the mud and turns it dark red. At least the adult is smart enough to stand on a rock.

                            <b>Shingle Cove, South Orkneys (2007) &mdash; </b>On Coronation Island, this muddy Adélie penguin chick is not having a good day—nor do the upcoming days hold much promise—in its horribly unfortunate attire. As evidenced by the color of the mud, a substantial amount of the Adélie penguin diet comes from krill, which contain red-staining iodine. The poor chick cannot even take a dip in the ocean to clean off because its down feathers aren’t waterproof. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

Aside from their roughed up skin, they have noticeable proboscises, the fleshly growths running along the tops of their snouts to their nostrils. (Photo by Dan Linehan)
