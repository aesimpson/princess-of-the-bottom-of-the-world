                            <b>Prion Island, South Georgia (2007) &mdash; </b>Antarctic fur seals are very territorial and aggressive. They bark loudly and even charge. I got charged at a bunch of times. I didn’t carry a walking stick or anything like that. If a fur seal did make a run at me, I’d have to lift my leg up so that its snout would hit the sole of my boot. That was enough to stop it and have it back away. I learned this trick from one of the guides—and I’m still walking around with both feet. However, these pups were just two big puffs of fur. They tried so hard to be fierce, tiny growling and all. It was completely endearing. I found myself saying to them, “Yes, I’m terrified. You’re doing such a fine job.” (Photo by Dan Linehan)

                            <b>St. Andrews Bay, South Georgia (2007) &mdash; </b>Overlooking the giant king penguin colony here, a chick stands on a dune formed by glacial sediment. The chick is called an oakum boy because the color and texture of its brown, down feathers make them resemble fragments of oakum rope used by sailors. Oakum and tar was used to plug holes and seal ships, so sailors given this task would be tar and oakum covered. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

                            <b>Shingle Cove, South Orkneys (2007) &mdash; </b>On Coronation Island, this muddy Adélie penguin chick is not having a good day—nor do the upcoming days hold much promise—in its horribly unfortunate attire. As evidenced by the color of the mud, a substantial amount of the Adélie penguin diet comes from krill, which contain red-staining iodine. The poor chick cannot even take a dip in the ocean to clean off because its down feathers aren’t waterproof. (Photo by Dan Linehan)

Finding animal-shaped icebergs wasn’t as difficult as it sounds. This eagle was discovered during a Zodiac cruise off the coast of Coronation Island. (Photo by Dan Linehan)
